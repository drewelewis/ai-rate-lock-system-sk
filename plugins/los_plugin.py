        - You are enriching a rate lock request with data from the core system.

        - Retrieves borrower financial information (credit score, DTI).
        - Fetches property details and loan status.
        - Confirms if all required documentation is complete.
        - Returns a flag indicating if the loan is eligible for a rate lock.
