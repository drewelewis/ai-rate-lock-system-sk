# AI Rate Lock Agents - Autonomous Mortgage Processing System

## Project Purpose

This project implements a multi-agent AI system designed to automate the mortgage rate lock process, reducing manual intervention and accelerating loan processing workflows. The system handles approximately **1,000 rate lock requests per week**, automatically progressing requests through their lifecycle and identifying cases that require human attention.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional mortgage rate lock processing involves multiple manual steps where requests often get stuck waiting for human analysis and intervention. This creates bottlenecks in the loan origination process and delays closing timelines for borrowers.

**Specific Challenges:**
- Manual email review and data extraction
- Loan eligibility validation requires human judgment
- Rate quote generation involves multiple system lookups
- Compliance checks are time-consuming and error-prone
- Confirmation document creation is manual and inconsistent
- Limited audit trail for regulatory requirements

---

## Solution Overview

The AI Rate Lock Agents system uses **Semantic Kernel (SK)** and **Azure OpenAI GPT-4o** to create autonomous agents that monitor rate lock requests and automatically progress them through completion. Each agent has specialized responsibilities and works collaboratively to move requests forward.

### ⚡ Core Innovation: Autonomous LLM Function Calling

Unlike traditional automation systems with hardcoded business logic, this system leverages **Semantic Kernel's automatic function calling** architecture:

1. **Agents are thin LLM wrappers** (~50-100 lines) that define WHAT to accomplish via system prompts
2. **LLMs autonomously decide** which plugin functions to call based on context (via `FunctionChoiceBehavior.Auto()`)
3. **Plugins contain ALL business logic** (database operations, API integrations, messaging)

**Example Architecture:**
```python
# Agent (50 lines) - Just defines role and available tools
class EmailIntakeAgent(BaseAgent):
    def _get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
        return """You are the Email Intake Agent.
        
        AVAILABLE TOOLS:
        - CosmosDB.create_rate_lock(...) - Create rate lock record
        - ServiceBus.send_workflow_event(...) - Notify next agent
        
        YOUR TASK: Parse email, create record, notify Loan Context Agent.
        Use tools autonomously to complete your task!
        """

# LLM autonomously calls plugins - NO explicit calls in agent code!
# Plugins registered with kernel for autonomous invocation
```

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- ❌ **NEVER** call plugins explicitly in agent code
- ✅ **ALWAYS** let LLM autonomously invoke plugins via Semantic Kernel
- ✅ Agents define prompts; LLMs decide which functions to call
- ✅ All business logic lives in plugins, not agents

## System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Design

The system consists of **seven specialized agents** that replicate the normal human-led process, each powered by Azure OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent decision-making:

## 🔄 Agent Interaction Patterns

### Sequential Processing

Agents typically operate in sequence:

```
1. EmailIntakeAgent 
   ↓
2. LoanApplicationContextAgent 
   ↓
3. RateQuoteAgent 
   ↓
4. ComplianceRiskAgent 
   ↓
5. LockConfirmationAgent
```

### Parallel Support

`AuditLoggingAgent` and `ExceptionHandlerAgent` operate continuously alongside primary agents

### Shared State Architecture

All agents read/write to shared loan lock state in **Azure Cosmos DB**, enabling coordination without direct coupling

### Error Recovery

Any agent can autonomously invoke `ExceptionHandlerAgent` when encountering unresolvable issues by publishing exception events

## Agent Communication Model

### Shared State Architecture

All agents operate on a shared loan lock entity stored in **Azure Cosmos DB**. This eliminates the need for complex inter-agent messaging while maintaining state consistency.

**Benefits:**
- Simple coordination without direct coupling
- Single source of truth for loan state
- Optimistic concurrency control prevents conflicts
- Complete audit trail via Cosmos DB change feed

---

### Event-Driven Coordination

**Azure Service Bus** triggers agent actions based on state changes:

| Message Type | Description | Target Agent |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| `email_received` | New email from Logic Apps | Email Intake Agent |
| `email_parsed` | Email data extracted | Loan Context Agent |
| `context_retrieved` | Loan eligibility validated | Rate Quote Agent |
| `rate_quoted` | Rate options generated | Compliance Risk Agent |
| `compliance_passed` | Compliance checks passed | Lock Confirmation Agent |
| `exception_occurred` | Error requiring escalation | Exception Handler Agent |

---

### Coordination Patterns

#### Primary Processing Flow

```
EmailIntake → LoanContext → RateQuote → Compliance → LockConfirmation
```

Each agent publishes to `loan-lifecycle-events` topic with appropriate `MessageType`, and Service Bus subscription filters route messages to the correct next agent.

#### Continuous Support Agents

- **AuditLoggingAgent**: Logs every agent action and state transition (receives ALL messages)
- **ExceptionHandlerAgent**: Monitors for failure conditions and escalates as needed (receives exceptions and high-priority messages)

#### Retry and Recovery

- Failed agent actions trigger automatic retries with exponential backoff (handled in BaseAgent)
- After retry exhaustion, ExceptionHandlerAgent creates human escalation cases
- State rollback capabilities for critical failures

#### Parallel Processing

- Multiple loan locks can be processed simultaneously
- Agents use optimistic locking to prevent concurrent modification conflicts
- Queue-based load balancing distributes work across agent instances

#### Message Flow Details

**Primary Workflow (Sequential Processing)**:

1. 📧 Email → `inbound-email-queue` → Email Intake Agent
2. Email Intake Agent → `loan-lifecycle-events` topic → Loan Context Agent
3. Loan Context Agent → `loan-lifecycle-events` topic → Rate Quote Agent
4. Rate Quote Agent → `loan-lifecycle-events` topic → Compliance Risk Agent
5. Compliance Risk Agent → `loan-lifecycle-events` topic → Lock Confirmation Agent
6. Lock Confirmation Agent → `outbound-email-queue` → 📧 Outbound Email

**Audit Flow (Parallel Logging)**:

- All agents publish events to `loan-lifecycle-events` topic
- Audit Logging Agent subscribes with filter `MessageType IS NOT NULL` (receives ALL messages)
- Maintains complete audit trail of all agent actions and state transitions

**Exception Flow (Error Handling)**:

- All agents can publish to `loan-lifecycle-events` topic with `Priority = 'high'`
- Exception Handler Agent processes exceptions and creates human alerts
- Critical exceptions trigger immediate notifications

**Topic Architecture**:

- **1 Primary Topic**: `loan-lifecycle-events` - Main workflow coordination
- **3 Queues**: Point-to-point messaging
  - `inbound-email-queue` - Email intake processing
  - `outbound-email-queue` - Email confirmations and notifications
  - `high-priority-exceptions` - Critical human intervention required
- **Subscriptions**: Each agent has dedicated subscriptions with SQL message filtering
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Automatic handling of failed message processing

### Core Technologies

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **AI Orchestration** | Semantic Kernel 1.0+ | Agent framework and autonomous function calling |

### Logic App Workflows

To make the system more robust and scalable, email interactions are handled by Azure Logic Apps, which integrate with the Service Bus.

**Inbound Workflow** (`inbound-email-processor`):
- **Trigger**: Activates when a new email arrives in a specific Office 365 inbox
- **Action**:
  1. Extracts the sender, subject, and body from the email
  2. Creates a JSON message containing the email data
  3. Sends this message to the `inbound-email-queue` Service Bus queue
- **Purpose**: Decouples the agents from the email server. The `EmailIntakeAgent` listens to this Service Bus queue instead of polling an inbox directly.

**Outbound Workflow** (`outbound-email-sender`):
- **Trigger**: Activates when a new message is received on the `outbound-email-queue` Service Bus queue
- **Action**:
  1. Parses the incoming JSON message to get the recipient, subject, body, and any attachments
  2. Uses the Office 365 connector to send the email
- **Purpose**: Allows any agent to send an email by simply placing a structured message on the Service Bus, without needing to handle SMTP or email APIs.

### Benefits of Service Bus for Agent Communication

Using Azure Service Bus as the backbone for communication between agents, rather than relying on in-process memory, provides several significant advantages that are critical for an enterprise-grade system:

- **Decoupling and Modularity**: Agents do not need direct knowledge of one another. An agent's only responsibility is to publish a message to a topic or listen for messages on a subscription. This loose coupling means individual agents can be updated, replaced, or tested independently without affecting the rest of the system.

- **Scalability**: Service Bus allows for competing consumers. If the volume of rate lock requests increases, you can scale out the system by running multiple instances of a specific agent (e.g., the `RateQuoteAgent`). Service Bus automatically distributes the message load across the available agent instances, enabling parallel processing. This is not possible with a single in-memory queue.

- **Reliability and Durability**: Messages sent to Service Bus are persisted to durable storage. If an agent process crashes midway through handling a task, the message is not lost. It remains safely in the queue and can be re-processed once the agent restarts or by another instance. In-memory data, by contrast, would be lost permanently.

- **Asynchronous Operations**: Agents can publish events or commands to the bus and immediately move on to their next task without waiting for a response. This non-blocking, asynchronous workflow improves the overall throughput and responsiveness of the system, as agents spend less time idle.

- **Advanced Messaging Features**: Service Bus provides sophisticated, out-of-the-box features that are complex to build and maintain manually:
  - **Topics and Subscriptions**: Allows for publish-subscribe patterns where one message can be delivered to multiple interested agents.
  - **Dead-Lettering**: Automatically isolates messages that repeatedly fail processing, preventing them from blocking the queue and allowing for later inspection and manual intervention.
  - **Message Ordering and Sessions**: Guarantees that related messages are processed in the correct sequence.

- **Resilience and Load Leveling**: If a downstream agent is slow or temporarily unavailable, messages simply accumulate in the Service Bus queue. This prevents the upstream agents from being blocked or failing and ensures that work is not lost during transient faults. The queue acts as a buffer that smooths out processing loads.

- **Observability**: Service Bus integrates seamlessly with Azure Monitor, providing detailed metrics on message throughput, queue lengths, and processing times. This makes it easier to monitor the health of the system, diagnose bottlenecks, and set up alerts for operational issues.

By leveraging Service Bus, the multi-agent system becomes more robust, scalable, and resilient, capable of handling production workloads reliably.

## Storage Architecture

The system employs a multi-tier storage strategy, each optimized for specific data patterns and access requirements:

### 🗃️ Azure Cosmos DB - Primary Data Storage

**Primary Use Cases**:
- **Loan Lock Records**: Complete rate lock entities with full lifecycle state
- **Application Context**: Loan origination system data and borrower information
- **Rate Lock History**: Historical records for audit and analytics
- **Configuration Data**: Agent settings, business rules, and system parameters

**Why Cosmos DB**:
- ✅ **Global Distribution**: Multi-region replication for high availability
- ✅ **Flexible Schema**: JSON documents adapt to evolving loan lock data structures
- ✅ **Automatic Scaling**: Handles variable workloads (1000+ requests/week with peaks)
- ✅ **ACID Transactions**: Ensures data consistency for critical financial operations
- ✅ **Multiple APIs**: SQL API for complex queries, perfect for loan data relationships
- ✅ **99.999% SLA**: Mission-critical uptime for mortgage processing

**Data Partitioning Strategy**:
```json
{
  "partitionKey": "/loanApplicationId",
  "indexingPolicy": {
    "includedPaths": [
      "/borrower/email/?",
      "/lockDetails/status/?",
      "/audit/lastModified/?",
      "/compliance/riskLevel/?"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Container Structure**:
- **RateLockRecords**: Main loan lock entities (partitioned by loan application ID)
- **AuditLogs**: Immutable audit trail (partitioned by date)
- **AgentConfiguration**: System configuration and business rules
- **ExceptionTracking**: Human escalation cases and resolution tracking

---

### 📨 Azure Service Bus - Message Queuing

**Primary Use Cases**:
- **Agent Coordination**: Triggering sequential agent workflows
- **Event-Driven Processing**: State change notifications between agents
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing work across multiple agent instances
- **Dead Letter Handling**: Managing failed message processing
- **Scheduled Operations**: Time-based triggers for rate expiration monitoring

**Why Service Bus**:
- ✅ **Enterprise Messaging**: Built for high-volume, mission-critical messaging
- ✅ **Message Ordering**: FIFO queues ensure proper processing sequence
- ✅ **Dead Letter Queues**: Automatic handling of failed messages
- ✅ **Topics & Subscriptions**: Publish-subscribe for broadcast notifications
- ✅ **Message Sessions**: Grouped processing for related loan applications
- ✅ **Duplicate Detection**: Prevents duplicate processing of rate lock requests
- ✅ **Integration**: Native Azure ecosystem integration

**Queue & Topic Architecture**:
```
📋 QUEUES (Point-to-Point)
├── inbound-email-queue        → EmailIntakeAgent
├── outbound-email-queue       → Email System
└── high-priority-exceptions   → Human Operators

📢 TOPICS (Publish-Subscribe)
└── loan-lifecycle-events      → All workflow agents (with filters)

Subscriptions (with SQL filters):
├── loan-context-sub           (MessageType = 'email_parsed')
├── rate-quote-sub             (MessageType = 'context_retrieved')
├── compliance-sub             (MessageType = 'rate_quoted')
├── lock-confirmation-sub      (MessageType = 'compliance_passed')
├── audit-sub                  (MessageType IS NOT NULL)
└── exception-sub              (Priority = 'high' OR 'critical')
```

**Message Flow Patterns**:
- **Sequential Processing**: Subscription filters route messages through workflow
- **Broadcast Events**: Audit agent receives ALL messages
- **Error Handling**: Dead letter queues for failed processing
- **Priority Processing**: High-priority exceptions bypass normal flow

---

### 🔄 Storage Integration Patterns

### Implementation Philosophy

**Agent Code** (~50-100 lines per agent):
- ✅ Define system prompt describing role and available tools
- ✅ Optional: Customize message formatting
- ❌ NO explicit plugin calls
- ❌ NO business logic
- ❌ NO error handling (handled by BaseAgent)

**Plugin Code** (as complex as needed):
- ✅ ALL business logic
- ✅ Database operations
- ✅ API integrations
- ✅ Error handling and retries
- ✅ Use `@kernel_function` decorator for LLM visibility

**Main.py** (generic orchestration only):

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the infrastructure, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

#### 1. Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is required for authentication and managing Azure resources.

**Installation**:
- **Windows**: Download from [Azure CLI for Windows](https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows) or use:
  ```cmd
  winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI
  ```
- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install azure-cli
  ```
- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
  ```

**Verification**:
```cmd
az --version
```

#### 2. Azure Developer CLI (azd)

Azure Developer CLI simplifies the process of developing and deploying applications to Azure.

**Installation**:
- **Windows**:
  ```cmd
  winget install microsoft.azd
  ```
- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew tap azure/azd && brew install azd
  ```
- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
  ```

**Verification**:
```cmd
azd version
```

**Note**: The minimum supported version is 1.11.0. If you have an older version, update using:
```cmd
# Windows
winget upgrade Microsoft.Azd

# macOS
brew upgrade azd

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
```

#### 3. Python Environment

The system requires Python 3.11 or higher with specific packages.

**Installation**:
- Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Ensure pip is installed and updated:
  ```cmd
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

**Install Required Packages**:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Key dependencies include**:
- `semantic-kernel` - AI orchestration framework
- `azure-identity` - Managed identity authentication
- `azure-cosmos` - Cosmos DB operations
- `azure-servicebus` - Service Bus messaging
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management

#### 4. Git

Git is required to clone and manage the repository.

**Installation**:
- **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install git
  ```
- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install git  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo yum install git  # RHEL/CentOS
  ```

---

### Infrastructure Setup Process

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/drewelewis/ai-rate-lock-system-sk.git
cd ai-rate-lock-system-sk
```

#### Step 2: Authenticate with Azure

**Login to Azure CLI**:
```cmd
az login
```

This opens a browser window for authentication. Follow the prompts to sign in with your Azure account.

**Set your subscription** (if you have multiple):
```cmd
az account list --output table
az account set --subscription "your-subscription-name-or-id"
```

**Login to Azure Developer CLI**:
```cmd
azd auth login
```

This may open another browser window for azd-specific authentication.

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Set the Azure region where you want to deploy resources:

```cmd
# Set your preferred Azure region
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus2

# The system will automatically detect your subscription ID
# But you can also set it manually if needed:
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID "your-subscription-id"
```

**Available Azure Regions for OpenAI**:
- `eastus` - East US
- `eastus2` - East US 2
- `westus` - West US
- `westus2` - West US 2
- `centralus` - Central US
- `northcentralus` - North Central US
- `southcentralus` - South Central US

**Note**: Choose a region that supports Azure OpenAI services. East US 2 is recommended for optimal performance and service availability.

#### Step 4: Initialize the Azure Developer Project

```cmd
azd init
```

When prompted:
- **Environment name**: Use `ai-rate-lock-dev` (or your preferred name)
- **Template**: The system will detect the existing `azure.yaml` configuration

#### Step 5: Deploy the Infrastructure

Deploy all Azure resources with a single command:

```cmd
azd up
```

This command will:

1. **Create a Resource Group** named `rg-{environment-name}` in your specified region

2. **Deploy Azure OpenAI** with GPT-4o and text-embedding-3-small models

3. **Deploy Azure Cosmos DB** with optimized containers:
   - `RateLockRecords` - Main loan data (partitioned by `/loanApplicationId`)
   - `AuditLogs` - System audit trails (partitioned by `/auditDate`)
   - `Configuration` - System settings (partitioned by `/configType`)
   - `Exceptions` - Error handling records (partitioned by `/priority`)

4. **Deploy Azure Service Bus** with queues and topics:
   - **Queues**: `inbound-email-queue`, `outbound-email-queue`, `high-priority-exceptions`
   - **Topics**: `loan-lifecycle-events`
   - **Subscriptions**: Agent-specific subscriptions for the topic with proper SQL filtering

5. **Deploy Application Insights** for monitoring and telemetry

6. **Deploy Log Analytics Workspace** for centralized logging

**Deployment Progress**: The deployment typically takes 3-5 minutes. You'll see progress indicators for each resource:

```
✓ Done: Azure OpenAI (18s)
✓ Done: Azure Cosmos DB (1m24s)
✓ Done: Service Bus Namespace (1m32s)
✓ Done: Application Insights (22s)
✓ Done: Log Analytics workspace (20s)
```

#### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

After successful deployment, set up your local environment:

```cmd
azd env get-values > .env
```

This creates a `.env` file with all necessary connection strings and endpoints:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_SERVICE_BUS_ENDPOINT`
- `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`
- And other required configuration values

#### Step 7: Verify Deployment

Test that all services are properly configured:

```cmd
python -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); from config.azure_config import azure_config; print(azure_config.get_configuration_summary())"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
🔧 Loading environment variables...

## Deployment

### Azure Developer CLI Deployment

The system uses `azd` for infrastructure as code:

```cmd
REM Deploy all Azure resources
azd up

REM Update just the infrastructure
azd provision

REM Deploy code changes (future - container deployment)
azd deploy
```

### Infrastructure Components

The Bicep templates (`infra/`) deploy:

1. **Azure OpenAI Service**
   - GPT-4o deployment (100K TPM quota recommended)
   - Managed identity access
   - Automatic retry and rate limiting

2. **Azure Service Bus (Standard)**
   - Single topic: `loan-lifecycle-events`
   - 6 subscriptions with SQL filters for intelligent routing
   - 3 queues for Logic Apps integration
   - Dead letter queue configuration

3. **Azure Cosmos DB (Serverless)**
   - 4 containers with optimized partitioning
   - Automatic scaling based on workload
   - Point-in-time backup enabled

4. **Azure Logic Apps** (optional)
   - Inbound email processor
   - Outbound email sender

5. **Azure Application Insights**
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Distributed tracing

### Rate Limiting Configuration

The system implements conservative rate limiting to stay 50% below Azure OpenAI quota:

**Current Settings** (for 100K TPM quota):
```python
MAX_CONCURRENT_OPENAI_CALLS = 2  # 2 concurrent calls
await asyncio.sleep(3)  # 3-second delay between calls
```

**Performance Profile**:
- **TPM Usage**: ~45,500 TPM (45.5% of 100K quota)
- **Safety Margin**: 54.5% unused quota
- **Throughput**: ~13 API calls/minute
- **Error Rate**: <1% expected

See [CONSERVATIVE_CONFIG_50PCT_QUOTA.md](CONSERVATIVE_CONFIG_50PCT_QUOTA.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Problems

```cmd
# Clear cached credentials
az logout
azd auth logout

# Re-authenticate
az login
azd auth login
```

### Deployment Failures

```cmd
# Check deployment logs
azd provision --debug

# Clean up failed deployment
azd down --purge
azd provision
```

### Environment Variable Issues

```cmd
# Regenerate environment file
azd env get-values > .env

# Verify configuration
python -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); from config.azure_config import azure_config; print(azure_config.get_configuration_summary())"
```

### Service Bus Lock Duration Errors

The Standard tier Service Bus has a maximum lock duration of 5 minutes. The templates are configured correctly, but if you modify them, ensure lock durations don't exceed `PT5M`.

---

## Cost Management

**Expected Monthly Costs (Development Environment)**:
- Azure OpenAI: ~$20-50 (based on usage)
- Cosmos DB: ~$25-40 (serverless tier)
- Service Bus: ~$10-20 (Standard tier)
- Application Insights: ~$5-15
- Log Analytics: ~$5-10

**Total**: Approximately $65-135/month

**Cost Optimization Tips**:
- Use serverless Cosmos DB for development
- Monitor OpenAI token usage
- Set up budget alerts in Azure
- Clean up resources when not in use: `azd down`

---

## Security Considerations

The infrastructure implements several security best practices:

1. **Managed Identity**: Services authenticate using managed identities (zero credentials)
2. **Private Endpoints**: Can be enabled for production environments
3. **Key Vault Integration**: Secrets stored securely (optional)
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Minimum required permissions
5. **Network Security**: Configurable IP restrictions
6. **Audit Trail**: Immutable logging for regulatory compliance

---
