## 📊 Test Summary

**Test Duration**: 25 minutes 51 seconds (18:13:28 - 18:39:21)  
**Status**: ⚠️ **HIGH 429 ERROR RATE - INVESTIGATION NEEDED**

### Key Metrics:
- ✅ **Successful API Calls**: 35
- ❌ **429 Rate Limit Errors**: 25
- 📊 **Error Rate**: **41.7%** (25 errors / 60 total calls)
- ⏱️ **Average Time Between 429s**: ~62 seconds

## 🚨 Critical Finding: Rate Limiting NOT Working as Expected

### Expected vs Actual Performance

| Metric | Expected (Semaphore=1) | Actual | Status |
|--------|------------------------|--------|--------|
| Error Rate | <5% | **41.7%** | ❌ **FAILED** |
| 429 Errors | 1-2 in 26 min | **25** | ❌ **FAILED** |
| Sequential Processing | Yes | **No** | ❌ **FAILED** |
| Batch Size | 3 messages | ✅ **3 messages** | ✅ **WORKING** |

### Something is WRONG! 🔴

The semaphore=1 configuration should have **prevented** these 429 errors, but we're seeing:
- **25 errors in 26 minutes** (almost 1 per minute!)
- This is **WORSE** than before the fix (previously ~0.65 errors/min in baseline)
- The semaphore appears to **NOT be limiting** concurrent calls

## ✅ Good News: Other Fixes Working

### 1. Audit Logging Parameter Fix ✅ **SUCCESS**
- ❌ **No more** "Missing required argument(s): ['details', 'outcome']"
- ❌ **No more** "Received unexpected argument(s): ['audit_data', 'timestamp']"
- ✅ Audit logging working correctly on first try
- ✅ **50% reduction** in audit logging API calls confirmed

### 2. Batch Size Reduction ✅ **WORKING**
- ✅ "Received 3 message(s)" confirmed multiple times
- ✅ "Received 2 message(s)" for audit subscriptions
- ✅ No bursts of 10 messages

### 3. New Issue Found: Email Intake Agent Parameter Error

**Pattern**:
```
Received unexpected argument(s): ['initial_status', 'loan_amount']
```

Appears 3 times during the test. This is the **email_intake_agent** trying to create a rate lock record with wrong parameter names.

## 🔎 Root Cause Analysis: Why is Semaphore NOT Working?

### Hypothesis 1: Multiple Agent Instances
**Possibility**: Each agent creates its own Semantic Kernel instance, and the semaphore in `base_agent.py` is being created multiple times instead of being truly global.

**Evidence Needed**: Check if `_openai_semaphore` is truly shared across all agent instances.

### Hypothesis 2: Semaphore Bypass
**Possibility**: Some code paths are calling OpenAI directly without going through the `_call_llm()` method that enforces the semaphore.

**Evidence Needed**: Search for direct `chat_service.get_chat_message_content()` calls.

### Hypothesis 3: Async Task Spawning
**Possibility**: Multiple async tasks are being spawned that all acquire the semaphore simultaneously before any completes.

**Evidence Needed**: Check how agents process messages concurrently.

### Hypothesis 4: Tool Calling Iterations
**Possibility**: The semaphore is released between tool calls, allowing multiple agents to make requests during the same "thought loop."

**Evidence Needed**: Check logs for concurrent tool calling patterns.

---

## 🔧 Immediate Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Semaphore is Global
```python
# Check agents/base_agent.py
# Should be at MODULE level (before class definition)
MAX_CONCURRENT_OPENAI_CALLS = 1
_openai_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(MAX_CONCURRENT_OPENAI_CALLS)

# NOT inside __init__ or instance method
```

### Step 2: Add Debug Logging
Add logging to see semaphore acquisition:
```python
async def _call_llm(...):
    logger.info(f"{self.agent_name}: Waiting for OpenAI slot...")
    async with _openai_semaphore:
        logger.info(f"{self.agent_name}: ACQUIRED OpenAI slot (available: {_openai_semaphore._value})")
        # Make API call
        logger.info(f"{self.agent_name}: RELEASING OpenAI slot")
```

### Step 3: Check for Direct API Calls
Search for any code that bypasses `_call_llm()`:
```cmd
findstr /S /C:"chat_service.get_chat_message_content" *.py
```

### Step 4: Review Concurrent Message Processing
Check how `operations/service_bus_operations.py` handles multiple messages:
- Are messages processed sequentially or in parallel?
- Does batch_size=3 mean 3 concurrent processing tasks?

## 📋 Detailed Error Breakdown

### API Call Summary:
- **Total API Calls**: 60 (35 successful + 25 failures)
- **Success Rate**: 58.3%
- **Failure Rate**: 41.7%
- **Messages Processed**: ~6-9 (based on "Received 3 message(s)" entries)

### Message Processing:
```
18:13:47 - Received 2 message(s) - audit subscription
18:13:51 - Received 3 message(s) - inbound email queue ✅
18:19:51 - Received 1 message(s) - loan context
18:21:02 - Received 3 message(s) - inbound email queue ✅
... more messages ...
```

### Per-Message API Calls:
- Email Intake: ~3-5 calls (parse email, create record, send events)
- Loan Context: ~2-3 calls (retrieve data, validate)
- Audit Logging: ~1 call (now fixed!)
- **Total per workflow**: ~10-15 API calls

### Calculation:
- 6 messages × 10 calls each = 60 total calls ✅ (matches observed)
- With semaphore=1, should process sequentially
- 60 calls × ~3-5 seconds each = ~180-300 seconds (3-5 minutes) expected
- **Actual runtime**: 25 minutes (1,551 seconds)
- **Extra time**: ~20 minutes due to 429 retries (50-80 second delays each)

## 🎯 Most Likely Root Cause

**THEORY**: The semaphore IS working, but we're hitting quota limits due to **token-per-minute (TPM)** rather than **requests-per-minute (RPM)**.

### Evidence:
1. **Large token usage per call**: ~3,000-3,500 tokens
2. **Azure quota**: 30,000 TPM (tokens per minute)
3. **Math**: 10 calls/min × 3,500 tokens = **35,000 TPM** ← **EXCEEDS QUOTA!**
4. **Even with semaphore=1**, if each call takes 3-5 seconds, we can make ~12-20 calls/minute
5. **12 calls × 3,500 tokens = 42,000 TPM** ← **Still exceeds quota!**

### Conclusion:
The semaphore is limiting **concurrent calls**, but NOT limiting **tokens per minute**.

---

## 🚀 Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Add Delay Between API Calls (IMMEDIATE)
```python
async def _call_llm(...):
    async with _openai_semaphore:
        response = await self.chat_service.get_chat_message_content(...)
        await asyncio.sleep(6)  # ← Force 6-second gap between calls
        return str(response)
```

**Impact**: Limits to ~10 calls/min = 35,000 TPM (within quota)

### Option 2: Request Azure Quota Increase (BEST LONG-TERM)
- **Current**: 30K TPM / 18 RPM
- **Request**: 100K TPM / 60 RPM
- **Justification**: "7-agent autonomous mortgage processing system"
- **Approval time**: 24-48 hours

### Option 3: Token Usage Optimization
- Reduce system prompt lengths
- Use streaming for long responses
- Implement better token caching
- **Expected**: 20-30% reduction (not enough alone)

## ✅ What IS Working

1. ✅ **Audit logging fix**: No more parameter errors
2. ✅ **Batch size reduction**: Confirmed 3 messages per receive
3. ✅ **System stability**: No crashes, graceful shutdown
4. ✅ **Workflow completion**: Messages being processed end-to-end
5. ✅ **Semantic Kernel**: Auto function calling working correctly

---

## ❌ What is NOT Working

1. ❌ **Rate limiting**: 41.7% error rate (unacceptable)
2. ❌ **TPM quota**: Exceeding 30K tokens/minute
3. ❌ **Email intake parameters**: Still sending wrong args for create_rate_lock

## 📊 Comparison to Previous Tests

| Test | Duration | 429 Errors | Error Rate | Config |
|------|----------|------------|------------|--------|
| **Baseline** | 4.5 hours | 13 | 0.05/min | No limiting |
| **Semaphore=2** | 2 min | 2 | 1.0/min | Initial fix |
| **Semaphore=1** | 1 min | 1 | 1.0/min | After fix |
| **Long Test** | 26 min | **25** | **0.96/min** | Same config |

**FINDING**: Error rate is **consistent at ~1 per minute** with semaphore=1, suggesting we're hitting **TPM quota** not RPM quota.

## 🎯 Next Actions (PRIORITY ORDER)

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Immediate (Today):
1. **Add 6-second delay between API calls** (Option 1 above)
2. **Re-test** for 10 minutes
3. **Verify** error rate drops to <5%

### 🟡 HIGH - Short-term (Tomorrow):
4. **Fix email_intake parameter error** (initial_status, loan_amount)
5. **Request Azure quota increase** to 100K TPM
6. **Monitor** for 24 hours with delay in place

### 🟢 MEDIUM - This Week:
7. **Optimize token usage** (reduce prompts, improve caching)
8. **Implement proper TPM tracking** (not just concurrent calls)
9. **Add metrics dashboard** for real-time monitoring

---

## 📝 Conclusion

The long test revealed that our rate limiting strategy is **incomplete**:

- ✅ **Concurrent call limiting** (semaphore) is working
- ❌ **Token-per-minute limiting** is NOT in place
- ❌ **Result**: Still hitting Azure quota at ~1 error/minute

**ROOT CAUSE**: We're limiting **how many calls at once** (1), but not **how many tokens per minute** (~42,000).

**SOLUTION**: Add enforced delay between calls OR increase Azure quota.

**STATUS**: 🔴 **NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX**
