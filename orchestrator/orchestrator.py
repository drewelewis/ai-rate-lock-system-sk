Agent Orchestrator (Currently Not Used)

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE: Event-Driven Coordination
===============================================

This orchestrator is currently a stub implementation and is NOT being used in the system.
The AI Rate Lock System uses an event-driven architecture instead of centralized orchestration.

CURRENT COORDINATION APPROACH:
------------------------------

1. **Service Bus Event-Driven Coordination**:
   - Agents communicate through Azure Service Bus topics and subscriptions
   - Each agent listens to specific message types with SQL filters
   - No central orchestrator needed - agents trigger each other via messages

2. **Shared State Architecture**:
   - All agents read/write to shared loan lock state in Cosmos DB
   - State changes trigger Service Bus events to notify relevant agents
   - Eliminates need for complex inter-agent messaging protocols

3. **Agent Flow Pattern**:
   Sequential: EmailIntake → LoanContext → RateQuote → Compliance → LockConfirmation
   Parallel:   AuditLogging and ExceptionHandler operate continuously

4. **Service Bus Topics**:
   - workflow-events: Main agent coordination (6 subscriptions)
   - audit-events: System audit trail (1 subscription) 
   - exception-alerts: Error handling (1 subscription)

5. **Message-Driven Triggers**:
   - new_request → EmailIntakeAgent
   - context_retrieved → RateQuoteAgent  
   - rates_presented → ComplianceRiskAgent
   - compliance_passed → LockConfirmationAgent
   - exception_occurred → ExceptionHandlerAgent

BENEFITS OF CURRENT APPROACH:
----------------------------
✅ Cloud-native and scalable
✅ Loose coupling between agents
✅ Automatic retry and dead letter handling
✅ Easy to monitor and debug
✅ Supports parallel processing
✅ Resilient to individual agent failures

WHEN TO USE CENTRALIZED ORCHESTRATOR:
-----------------------------------
Consider implementing this orchestrator if you need:
- Complex workflow branching logic
- Dynamic agent routing based on loan characteristics
- Centralized workflow state management
- Step-by-step workflow visualization
- Complex error recovery with rollback capabilities
- Audit trail of orchestration decisions

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
-------------------
If you decide to implement centralized orchestration:
1. This orchestrator would subscribe to all Service Bus topics
2. Maintain workflow state separate from loan state
3. Route tasks to agents based on business rules
4. Handle complex exception scenarios
5. Provide workflow monitoring and metrics

For now, the event-driven approach is working well and aligns with
modern microservices and serverless architectures.
