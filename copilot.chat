The loan lock process (also called a rate lock) is a key step in securing a mortgage or other type of loan. It refers to an agreement between a borrower and a lender to "lock in" the interest rate on a loan for a specified period of time, typically from the time of application through to closing.
üîê Here's how the loan lock process works:


When it Happens:

A borrower can choose to lock the rate at the time of application or any time before closing.
Locking is often done when interest rates are favorable and the borrower wants to avoid the risk of them rising.



What It Locks:

Interest rate (most important)
Sometimes also points, fees, or loan terms



Lock Period:

Typically ranges from 15 to 60 days, but can be longer.
The lock must be valid through the expected closing date.



Why It Matters:

If rates go up, you're protected.
If rates go down, you may not benefit unless your lender offers a "float-down" option.



What Happens If It Expires:

If the loan doesn‚Äôt close before the lock expires, you may:

Pay a fee to extend the lock.
Accept the current market rate (which could be higher or lower).





Types of Rate Locks:

Standard Lock: Fixed rate for a set period.
Float-Down Lock: Allows you to take advantage of a lower rate if it drops during the lock period (usually at a cost).
Lock and Shop: Lets you lock a rate before finding a property (offered by some lenders).

Provide your feedback on BizChatYou said: I am building a system where users send an email to the mortgage company to get start the rate lock process.  This will be an agentic system.  I want to build this as a multi-agent design... What agents would you use to replicate the normal human led process?Copilot said: CopilotThat‚Äôs a great use case for a multi-agent system, Drew ‚Äî especially since the loan lock process involves multiple steps, stakeholders, and validations. Here's a breakdown of how you could model this using agentic design, with each agent replicating a role typically handled by a human in the mortgage rate lock process.

üß† Multi-Agent Design for Loan Lock Initiation via Email
1. Email Intake Agent

Role: Monitors the inbox for new loan lock requests.
Tasks:

Parse incoming emails.
Extract borrower details, loan application ID, property address, and requested lock terms.
Validate sender identity (e.g., match email to known borrower records).


Tools: Outlook Graph API, Azure Logic Apps, or Semantic Kernel email skill.

2. Loan Application Context Agent

Role: Retrieves and verifies loan application data.
Tasks:

Pull borrower‚Äôs loan file from LOS (Loan Origination System).
Check loan status (e.g., pre-approved, underwritten).
Confirm eligibility for rate lock.


Tools: API integration with Encompass, Blend, or other LOS.

3. Rate Quote Agent

Role: Fetches current rate lock options.
Tasks:

Query pricing engine (e.g., Optimal Blue, MCT, Polly).
Match borrower‚Äôs loan profile to available rate lock terms.
Return options (e.g., 30-day lock @ 6.25%, 45-day @ 6.375%).


Optional: Include float-down or lock-and-shop options.

4. Compliance & Risk Agent

Role: Ensures the lock request complies with internal and regulatory guidelines.
Tasks:

Check lock window vs. estimated closing date.
Validate lock fees, disclosures, and timing.
Flag any exceptions (e.g., expired pre-approval, missing disclosures).



5. Lock Confirmation Agent

Role: Executes the lock and sends confirmation.
Tasks:

Submit lock request to pricing engine or LOS.
Generate lock confirmation document.
Email borrower and loan officer with confirmation and next steps.



6. Audit & Logging Agent

Role: Maintains a record of all actions for compliance and traceability.
Tasks:

Log timestamps, agent actions, and decisions.
Store audit trail in a secure, queryable format (e.g., Azure Table Storage, Cosmos DB).




üß© Optional Supporting Agents

Exception Handler Agent: Escalates issues to a human loan officer if something goes wrong.
Notification Agent: Sends SMS or push notifications to borrowers or internal staff.
Analytics Agent: Tracks lock trends, timing, and borrower behavior for optimization.

Provide your feedback on BizChatYou said: I like what you have here... I would like to see a json entity design that would represent a completed loan lock.  At a minimum it should have a status field and any other meta data required for a rate lock.Copilot said: CopilotHere‚Äôs a sample JSON entity design for a completed loan lock. This structure is designed to be extensible and agent-friendly, capturing all the key metadata typically involved in a mortgage rate lock process.

üßæ Sample JSON: LoanLock Entity

‚úÖ Key Design Considerations:

status is central for tracking the lifecycle of the lock.
lockDetails encapsulates all rate-specific metadata.
compliance ensures regulatory and internal policy checks are tracked.
audit supports traceability for agentic workflows.
notifications helps agents coordinate borrower and staff communication.

Would you like a schema definition (e.g., JSON Schema or OpenAPI) for validation or integration into your system?
Provide your feedback on BizChatYou said: I like the JSON you presented, knowing that this is a final state of the JSON once the lock is in place.  Can you give me a few examples of other states and what field you expect to have values, and what ones could be empty?Copilot said: CopilotGreat question, Drew. Since you're designing an agentic system, it's helpful to define stateful representations of the LoanLock entity as it progresses through its lifecycle. Below are a few key states with examples of which fields would be populated, optional, or empty at each stage.

üîÑ Loan Lock Lifecycle States
1. PendingRequest

The borrower has initiated a lock request (e.g., via email), but no action has been taken yet.

JSON{  "status": "PendingRequest",  "loanApplicationId": "LA-20250815-04567",  "borrower": {    "name": "Jane Doe",    "email": "jane.doe@example.com"  },  "lockDetails": {    "status": "PendingRequest"  },  "audit": {    "createdBy": "agent:EmailIntakeAgent",    "createdAt": "2025-09-27T14:00:00Z"  }}Show more lines
‚úÖ Populated: borrower, loanApplicationId, status, audit
‚ùå Empty: rate, lockDate, lockExpirationDate, compliance, notifications

2. UnderReview

The system is validating eligibility and fetching rate options.

JSON{  "status": "UnderReview",  "loanApplicationId": "LA-20250815-04567",  "borrower": { ... },  "lockDetails": {    "status": "UnderReview",    "loanAmount": 450000,    "loanType": "Conventional"  },  "audit": {    "createdBy": "agent:EmailIntakeAgent",    "lastUpdatedBy": "agent:LoanApplicationContextAgent"  }}Show more lines
‚úÖ Populated: loanAmount, loanType, status, audit
‚ùå Empty: rate, lockDate, lockExpirationDate, compliance, notifications

3. RateOptionsPresented

The system has fetched rate options and is awaiting borrower confirmation.

JSON{  "status": "RateOptionsPresented",  "lockDetails": {    "status": "RateOptionsPresented",    "rateOptions": [      { "termDays": 30, "rate": 6.25 },      { "termDays": 45, "rate": 6.375 }    ],    "lockSource": "Optimal Blue"  },  "audit": {    "lastUpdatedBy": "agent:RateQuoteAgent"  }}Show more lines
‚úÖ Populated: rateOptions, lockSource
‚ùå Empty: lockDate, lockExpirationDate, compliance, notifications

4. Locked

Final state ‚Äî lock confirmed and documented (as shown in your original request).

‚úÖ All fields populated, including:

rate, lockDate, lockExpirationDate
compliance.disclosuresSent, lockFee
notifications.borrowerNotified


5. Expired

Lock was not used before expiration.

JSON{  "status": "Expired",  "lockDetails": {    "status": "Expired",    "lockDate": "2025-08-15T10:00:00Z",    "lockExpirationDate": "2025-09-15T23:59:59Z",    "rate": 6.25  },  "audit": {    "lastUpdatedBy": "agent:AuditAgent"  }}Show more lines
‚úÖ Populated: rate, lockDate, lockExpirationDate
‚ùå Empty: notifications, compliance (unless disclosures were sent)

6. Cancelled

Lock was manually cancelled (e.g., borrower changed loan type or withdrew).

JSON{  "status": "Cancelled",  "lockDetails": {    "status": "Cancelled",    "cancelReason": "Borrower switched to ARM product"  },  "audit": {    "lastUpdatedBy": "agent:ExceptionHandlerAgent"  }}Show more lines
‚úÖ Populated: cancelReason, status
‚ùå Empty: rate, lockDate, compliance, notifications

Provide your feedback on BizChatYou said: ok, my company gets about 1000 rate lock requests per week, and they are all in different states.  Some get stuck in the process and take longer for human analysis.  I want to create a multi-agent solution where the agents look at the queue or database records and find rate locks that are not locked, cancelled, or expired, and each agent works autonomously to complete the process.  The agents could email the user, do analysis, do further research, etc. to keep the rate lock request moving.  I want to use SK for this.  What would you recommend?  Is this feasible?Memory updatedMemory updatedCopilot said: CopilotYes ‚Äî this is absolutely feasible with Semantic Kernel (SK), and your use case is a perfect fit for a multi-agent orchestration model. Here's how I‚Äôd recommend approaching it:

üß† System Overview: Autonomous Rate Lock Agents
üéØ Goal:
Continuously monitor a queue of ~1000 weekly rate lock requests, identify those that are not in a terminal state (Locked, Cancelled, Expired), and autonomously progress them using specialized agents.

üß© Recommended Agent Architecture
1. Queue Monitor Agent

Role: Periodically scans the database or queue.
Action: Filters records where status ‚àâ {Locked, Cancelled, Expired}.
Output: Dispatches tasks to downstream agents.


2. State Evaluator Agent

Role: Determines why a request is stuck.
Action: Uses embeddings or rules to classify the issue:

Missing borrower response
Incomplete loan file
Rate options not generated
Compliance check pending




3. Action Agents (Autonomous Workers)



































AgentRoleExample ActionsEmail AgentCommunicates with borrower or LORequest missing docs, confirm lock termsRate Quote AgentFetches updated rate optionsCalls pricing engine APIsCompliance AgentValidates disclosures, lock windowsRuns rule checksEscalation AgentFlags complex casesNotifies human analyst or LOAudit AgentLogs all actionsUpdates metadata and status
Each agent can be implemented as a SK Planner + Function set, with memory and context.

üõ†Ô∏è Semantic Kernel Implementation Strategy
‚úÖ Skills & Plugins

Email Skill: Send/receive borrower communications
Database Skill: Query/update rate lock records
Pricing Engine Skill: Fetch rate options
Compliance Skill: Run rule-based checks
Planner Skill: Use semantic reasoning to decide next steps

üß† Memory & Context

Use SK Memory to store:

Borrower interaction history
Prior agent actions
Rate lock metadata


Enables agents to act autonomously but contextually.

üîÅ Orchestration

Use Planner chaining or custom orchestrator to:

Assign agents based on state
Retry or escalate if no progress
Track time-in-state for SLAs




üìä Example Flow

Queue Monitor Agent finds 200 active requests.
For each:

State Evaluator Agent determines it's missing borrower confirmation.
Email Agent sends a personalized follow-up.
If no response in 48h, Escalation Agent notifies LO.




‚úÖ Feasibility Notes

Scalable: SK agents can run in parallel (e.g., Azure Functions, Durable Tasks).
Composable: Each agent is modular and testable.
Traceable: Audit logs and memory snapshots ensure compliance.

üß† Sample Planner Prompt: LockProgressionPlanner
Plain TextYou are an autonomous agent responsible for progressing a mortgage rate lock request toward completion.You are given the following context:- LoanLock status: {{status}}- Last agent action: {{lastAction}}- Time in current state: {{timeInState}} hours- Borrower email: {{borrower.email}}- Missing fields: {{missingFields}}Your goal is to determine the next best action to move this request forward. Choose from the following actions:- "SendBorrowerEmail"- "FetchRateOptions"- "RunComplianceCheck"- "EscalateToHuman"- "WaitForResponse"Respond with the best action and a short reason.Show more lines

üîÑ Communications Model
üîÅ Agent-to-Agent Communication

Agents write to a shared memory store (e.g., Redis, Cosmos DB, or SK Memory).
Each agent reads the latest state and decides if it should act.
Use status + lastUpdatedBy + timeInState to avoid duplication or race conditions.

üì¨ Agent-to-Human Communication

EmailSkill sends templated messages to:

Borrowers (e.g., ‚ÄúWe need your confirmation to proceed with your rate lock.‚Äù)
Loan Officers (e.g., ‚ÄúThis request has been stuck for 48h. Please review.‚Äù)



üßæ Logging & Audit

Every agent logs:

Action taken
Timestamp
Reason
Outcome (success/failure)

Pythonfrom semantic_kernel.planners import FunctionCallingPlannerplanner_prompt = """You are an autonomous agent responsible for progressing a mortgage rate lock request toward completion.Context:- LoanLock status: {{status}}- Last agent action: {{last_action}}- Time in current state: {{time_in_state}} hours- Borrower email: {{borrower_email}}- Missing fields: {{missing_fields}}Choose the next best action:- "send_borrower_email"- "fetch_rate_options"- "run_compliance_check"- "escalate_to_human"- "wait_for_response"Respond with the best action and a short reason."""Show more lines
You can use this with FunctionCallingPlanner or StepwisePlanner depending on your orchestration style.

üîÑ 3. Agent Communication Model
Shared Memory (e.g., Redis, Cosmos DB, or SK Memory)
Each agent:

Reads the current state of a LoanLock record.
Writes back its action, timestamp, and outcome.

Agent-to-Agent Coordination
Agents do not call each other directly. Instead:

The Orchestrator assigns tasks based on planner output.
Each agent is stateless, relying on shared memory and context.

Agent-to-Human Communication

email_skill.py sends templated messages via SMTP or Graph API.
escalation_skill.py notifies loan officers or analysts when needed.


‚úÖ Next Steps
Would you like me to:

Generate a starter Python project scaffold as a downloadable zip?
Provide a sample implementation of one of the agents (e.g., email_skill.py)?
Help you wire this into Azure Functions or a task queue for scale?

Let‚Äôs get this system running!
Provide your feedback on BizChatYou said: Before you do anything, would this simply run as a monolith in Azure Container Apps?Copilot said: CopilotYes ‚Äî running this as a monolith in Azure Container Apps (ACA) is a very viable and pragmatic starting point, especially for prototyping and early production. Here's how it maps out:

‚úÖ Why ACA Works Well for This
1. Simple Deployment

Package your entire SK-based multi-agent system into a single container.
Deploy it as a single ACA revision with autoscaling based on queue size or CPU.

2. Built-in Scaling

ACA supports KEDA-based autoscaling, so you can scale based on:

Queue length (e.g., Azure Service Bus, Storage Queue)
HTTP traffic
Custom metrics (e.g., number of active rate lock requests)



3. Cost-Effective

You only pay for what you use.
Ideal for workloads that spike (e.g., Monday morning rate lock surges).


üß† Monolith Design Considerations
‚úÖ Works Well For:

Shared memory or state (e.g., Redis, Cosmos DB)
Centralized logging and audit
Easier debugging and observability
Coordinated agent orchestration

‚ö†Ô∏è Watch Out For:

Long-running tasks: Use background workers or async queues to avoid blocking.
Agent isolation: If agents grow in complexity, consider breaking them into microservices later.
Concurrency: Use locks or idempotency keys to avoid duplicate processing.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
Provide your feedback on BizChatYou said: If I used azure storage bus, what other data storage would I need?Copilot said: CopilotIf you're using Azure Service Bus as your messaging backbone, you'll still need additional data storage to support the full lifecycle of your rate lock processing system. Here's a breakdown of what you'd need and why:

üß± Core Storage Components
1. Primary Data Store: Rate Lock Records

Purpose: Store the full LoanLock entity (status, borrower info, timestamps, etc.)
Recommended Options:

Azure Cosmos DB (flexible JSON, fast queries, global scale)
Azure Table Storage (cheaper, good for structured key-value)
Azure SQL Database (if you need relational joins or reporting)




‚úÖ Use this to persist the state of each rate lock request across agents.


2. Message Queue: Azure Service Bus

Purpose: Trigger agent actions (e.g., ‚Äúnew request received‚Äù, ‚Äúrequest stuck for 48h‚Äù)
Use Cases:

Decouple agent execution
Retry failed tasks
Schedule delayed actions (e.g., follow-up emails)




‚úÖ Use topics + subscriptions if you want multiple agents to react to the same event.


3. Agent Memory / Context Store

Purpose: Store intermediate agent decisions, embeddings, or chat history
Recommended Options:

Azure Redis (fast, ephemeral memory)
Azure Cosmos DB (if you want to persist agent memory long-term)
Semantic Kernel Memory Store (for embeddings, if using vector search)




‚úÖ Useful for agents that need to remember past actions or conversations.


4. Audit & Logging

Purpose: Track what each agent did, when, and why (for compliance and debugging)
Recommended Options:

Azure Application Insights (telemetry + logs)
Azure Blob Storage (for raw logs or JSON snapshots)
Log Analytics / Azure Monitor (for querying logs)




‚úÖ Helps with traceability and SLA monitoring.
